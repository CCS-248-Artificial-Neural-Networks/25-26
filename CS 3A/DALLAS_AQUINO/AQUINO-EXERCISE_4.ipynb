      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, remains one of the most iconic\n",
      "datasets in machine learning and pattern recognition. Consisting of 150 samples from three\n",
      "species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), each described by four\n",
      "morphological features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), this\n",
      "dataset presents a well-structured three-class classification problem. While the Iris\n",
      "dataset is relatively small and linearly separable for some class pairs, it provides an\n",
      "excellent testbed for comparing optimization algorithms in neural network training.\n",
      "\n",
      "This experiment investigates how different Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) variants\n",
      "perform when training a neural network to classify Iris species. We compare vanilla SGD\n",
      "(learning rate only), enhanced SGD with learning rate decay and momentum, and enhanced\n",
      "SGD with Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad). The evaluation focuses on two critical metrics:\n",
      "(a) convergence speed (epochs to loss stabilization), and (b) final classification\n",
      "accuracy on all 150 Iris samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "METHODOLOGY\n",
      "\n",
      "The experimental setup involved training a feedforward neural network on the complete Iris\n",
      "dataset (150 samples, no train/test split for consistency). The network architecture \n",
      "consisted of an input layer with 4 neurons (matching the four Iris features), a hidden \n",
      "layer with 64 neurons using ReLU activation, and an output layer with 3 neurons (one per\n",
      "Iris species) using Softmax activation. Categorical cross-entropy loss was used as the\n",
      "objective function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each optimizer configuration was tested independently with identical initial conditions\n",
      "(random seed = 42 for reproducibility). Training proceeded for 1000 epochs, with loss\n",
      "stabilization defined as achieving 50 consecutive epochs where loss variation remained\n",
      "below 0.001. This criterion ensures that the model has genuinely converged rather than\n",
      "temporarily plateaued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three optimizer configurations tested were:\n",
      "1. Vanilla SGD: learning_rate=0.1, no decay, no momentum, no AdaGrad\n",
      "2. Enhanced SGD (Decay + Momentum): learning_rate=0.1, decay=0.001, momentum=0.9\n",
      "3. Enhanced SGD (AdaGrad): learning_rate=0.1, AdaGrad enabled\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Loss Stabilization Performance on Iris Classification\n",
      "\n",
      "The vanilla SGD optimizer established the baseline convergence behavior. With a constant\n",
      "learning rate of 0.1, the optimizer made uniform-sized gradient steps throughout all 1000\n",
      "epochs. On the Iris dataset, this approach exhibited characteristic oscillation behavior,\n",
      "particularly in the later training stages. The optimizer could identify the general region\n",
      "of good solutions (evidenced by decreasing loss), but the constant step size prevented it\n",
      "from fine-tuning to settle precisely at the optimum. This manifested as continued small\n",
      "fluctuations in loss even after hundreds of epochs, delaying stabilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enhanced SGD with learning rate decay and momentum demonstrated markedly improved\n",
      "convergence on the Iris classification task. The learning rate decay (formula: current_lr = \n",
      "0.1 / (1 + 0.001 × iterations)) meant that early epochs benefited from aggressive learning\n",
      "(larger steps to quickly navigate toward good solutions), while later epochs employed\n",
      "increasingly conservative updates (smaller steps for precision tuning). The momentum term\n",
      "(0.9) proved particularly valuable for the Iris dataset by accumulating gradient information\n",
      "across batches, creating smoother optimization trajectories that more efficiently navigated\n",
      "the loss landscape. This combination typically achieved stabilization significantly earlier\n",
      "than vanilla SGD, demonstrating faster convergence to reliable solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AdaGrad variant exhibited distinctive convergence characteristics on the Iris dataset.\n",
      "By maintaining separate adaptive learning rates for each of the network's parameters,\n",
      "AdaGrad could handle the varying scales and importance of different features (sepal vs.\n",
      "petal measurements). Parameters corresponding to highly informative features received\n",
      "appropriately scaled updates, while less informative features had their learning rates\n",
      "adjusted accordingly. However, AdaGrad's monotonic learning rate reduction (denominator\n",
      "grows continuously as squared gradients accumulate) sometimes led to premature convergence,\n",
      "particularly in later epochs where learning rates became very small.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Classification Accuracy on Iris Species\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate goal of training is accurate species classification, making final accuracy the\n",
      "most critical performance metric. The vanilla SGD optimizer typically achieved respectable\n",
      "accuracy on the Iris dataset—the problem is not overly complex, and even basic optimization\n",
      "can learn reasonable decision boundaries. However, vanilla SGD's tendency to oscillate\n",
      "around optimal solutions rather than converge precisely to them sometimes resulted in\n",
      "suboptimal final accuracy, particularly for distinguishing the more similar Versicolor and\n",
      "Virginica species.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhanced SGD with learning rate decay and momentum consistently demonstrated superior\n",
      "classification performance on the Iris dataset. The momentum term helped the optimizer\n",
      "build \"velocity\" in productive directions, effectively navigating through the parameter\n",
      "space to find decision boundaries that better separated the three Iris species. The\n",
      "learning rate decay ensured that once the optimizer found promising regions, it could\n",
      "fine-tune the weights and biases with precision. This combination typically yielded higher\n",
      "accuracy, with the model achieving more confident and correct classifications across all\n",
      "three species—Setosa (linearly separable), Versicolor (moderately separable), and\n",
      "Virginica (most challenging to distinguish from Versicolor).\n",
      "\n",
      "The AdaGrad optimizer's performance on Iris classification reflected its adaptive nature.\n",
      "By scaling learning rates based on gradient history, AdaGrad could emphasize learning from\n",
      "informative features (particularly petal measurements, which are more discriminative for\n",
      "Iris species) while de-emphasizing less relevant ones. This feature-adaptive behavior\n",
      "sometimes led to competitive or even superior accuracy compared to other methods, though\n",
      "results varied depending on whether the aggressive learning rate reduction helped (by\n",
      "preventing overshooting) or hindered (by stopping learning prematurely) convergence to\n",
      "optimal decision boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Iris Dataset Characteristics and Optimizer Interaction\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iris dataset's specific characteristics influenced optimizer performance in notable\n",
      "ways. With only 150 samples, the entire dataset fits easily in memory, and batch gradient\n",
      "descent effectively uses all samples in each update. This means the gradient estimates are\n",
      "less noisy than they would be with mini-batch or stochastic updates on larger datasets,\n",
      "potentially reducing the advantage of momentum-based smoothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the presence of three classes with varying separability (Setosa is easily\n",
      "distinguished, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap significantly) created a loss\n",
      "landscape with multiple regions of different curvature. Enhanced optimizers with adaptive\n",
      "mechanisms proved better at navigating these varying regions, adjusting their behavior as\n",
      "needed to handle both the easy and difficult classification boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four input features also have different scales and discriminative power. Petal length\n",
      "and petal width are particularly informative for species classification, while sepal\n",
      "measurements provide additional but less decisive information. AdaGrad's parameter-wise\n",
      "learning rate adaptation proved relevant here, potentially allowing faster learning for\n",
      "the more informative features.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental difference between vanilla and enhanced SGD optimizers lies in their\n",
      "adaptability to the Iris classification problem. Vanilla SGD treats all epochs, all\n",
      "parameters, and all gradients uniformly—same learning rate from epoch 1 to epoch 1000,\n",
      "same update magnitude for petal-related and sepal-related weights. This uniformity is\n",
      "simple and predictable but fails to exploit problem structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhanced optimizers introduce intelligent adaptation specifically beneficial for Iris\n",
      "classification. Learning rate decay provides temporal adaptation: aggressive initial\n",
      "learning to quickly find the vicinity of good species separations, followed by cautious\n",
      "refinement for precision. Momentum adds trajectory memory, building directional confidence\n",
      "that helps overcome small obstacles in the loss landscape (particularly useful for\n",
      "separating Versicolor and Virginica). AdaGrad offers parameter-wise adaptation, treating\n",
      "each weight according to its update history—valuable when input features have different\n",
      "scales and importance for distinguishing Iris species.\n",
      "\n",
      "These adaptations directly address vanilla SGD's limitations in the context of Iris\n",
      "classification, typically resulting in both faster convergence (fewer epochs to stable\n",
      "loss) and better final performance (higher accuracy in distinguishing all three species).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "This comparative analysis demonstrates that optimizer selection significantly impacts both\n",
      "training efficiency and classification performance on the Iris dataset. While vanilla SGD\n",
      "with a constant learning rate provides a functional baseline capable of learning basic\n",
      "species distinctions, enhanced variants incorporating learning rate decay, momentum, and\n",
      "adaptive gradients offer substantial improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Iris classification task specifically, enhanced optimizers achieved faster\n",
      "convergence to stable loss values and typically higher final accuracy in distinguishing\n",
      "Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. These improvements stem from the enhanced\n",
      "optimizers' ability to adapt their behavior—adjusting learning rates over time, accumulating\n",
      "gradient momentum for smoother trajectories, and scaling updates per parameter based on\n",
      "historical information.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings highlight an important lesson for practical machine learning: even on\n",
      "relatively simple datasets like Iris, optimization algorithm choice matters. The difference\n",
      "between basic and enhanced optimizers can mean the difference between a model that slowly\n",
      "learns adequate decision boundaries and one that rapidly converges to superior species\n",
      "classification performance. For practitioners working with Iris or similar small-scale\n",
      "classification problems, investing in proper optimizer selection and tuning yields\n",
      "measurable benefits in both training time and final model quality.\n",
